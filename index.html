            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                My name is Owen Rasor, and I am a Software Engineering student at Utah Valley University.
                In addition to my studies, I have built a small business called XTRAJANK, where I design and
                screen print unique apparel. I personally manage everything from design and printing to selling
                at local markets. This experience has strengthened my ability to think creatively, solve problems
                efficiently, and adapt to new challenges.
            </p>
            <p>I have worked on a variety of software development projects, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Memory Simulator (Python, kivy): A virtual machine that executes Basic Machine Language and simulates memory management.</li>
                <li>File Transfer Appliction (Python, tkinter): A program for secure and efficient file transfers.</li>
                <li>Simple Banking Application (C#): A system for account management.</li>
                <li>Circular Buffer (C++): A high performance data structure for managing a fixed-size buffer.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                In addition to Python, C++, and C#, I have experience with C, .NET, Kivy, Tkinter, and Git.
                I enjoy working on both low-level systems programming and GUI development, allowing me to create
                intuitive and functional applications.
            </p>
            <p>
                On the creative side, I have screen printed hundreds of designs on t-shirts,
                hoodies, blankets, and tote bags. I find fulfillment in both coding and design, as both
                require problem-solving, attention to detail, and innovation.
            </p>
            <h3>My Goals</h3>
            <p>
                My goal is to become a software engineer where I can apply my creativity, knowledge, and skills
                to build meaningful applications. I am passionate about designing efficient, user-friendly software and
                constantly seeking opportunities to grow and learn in the field.

                <h3>UVSim</h3>
                <p>
                    UVSim is a virtual machine that executes Basic Machine Language. It is given the BML via a .txt file.
                    This file is validated and stored into the virtual memory. The user has the ability to step through, execute, and save
                    the program. The memory is displayed on the table to the right and the accumulator and outputs are displayed on the left.
                    It handles all input errors and runs efficiently.
                </p>

                <h3>onia File Transfer App</h3>
                <p>
                    onia is a file transfer app that receives a file and sends it efficiently via ports to the receiver.
                    I built onia as an opportunity to understand computer networks better and how ports worked specifically.

                <h3>Bank App</h3>
                <p>
                    The bank app I wrote is a very simple app that handles and stores accounts. It verifies deposits and withdrawals for those accounts.
                    I wrote it to learn and practice C# and .NET.
